Create a lock screen for your Windows or Windows Mobile with your personal images.

There is no more personalization for your lock screen.
The app offers a specially developed cut mask for your images, through which a new, personal lock screen is created again and again.
8.1 Lock screen creates a new lock screen from your images at regular, freely adjustable intervals.
A random pattern always creates a new, unique lock screen from the previously cut images.

Have fun!
